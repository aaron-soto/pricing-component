## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- useContext, useState, useEffect hooks

### What I learned

The biggest take-away from this project was having different component parts in the Pricing card and passing state along to all the individual components using the `useContext` hook.

### Continued development

I really enjoyed and plan on learning more about dynamically rendering the numbers in this component based on wether the user checked a box. It was a good challenge to put together multiple aspects of react to get the desired effect.

### Useful resources

- [w3 How to range sliders](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) - This resource helped me to disect the input type range slider and understand the individual parts better. I definitely plan on using this component more in the future.
